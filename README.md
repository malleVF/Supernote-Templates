# Templates and Sticker Collection for Supernote
 
This is a collection of templates and stickers that I use on my E-Ink tablet Supernote (https://www.supernote.com).
For my [Obsidian templates](https://github.com/malleVF/Obsidian-Templates) I have published another repo on github.

I could use Obsidian on a Supernote device, but I have decided against it. Instead, I use a plugin in Obsidian to copy my Supernote notes to my Obsidian vault when it makes sense for me. On the other hand, I can import an Obsidian note as a PDF file to read it in Supernote or use it as a template. 
 
## Supernote Templates

I create my Supernote templates mostly with PowerPoint and import them as PDF files. You can also use PNG images as templates, but they are rather static and only suitable for one-sided templates. In order to make my templates in Supernote more interactive, I decided to use PDF, because I can link to other pages within the template.

All the icons in my templates are from https://lucide.dev/icons/. 

I prefer the scribble style in my Supernote. That's why I redesigned the Lucide icons to match this style. For the font, I use [Excalifont](https://plus.excalidraw.com/excalifont) as my preferred style.

## Supernote Stickers
With the March 2025 update, the Supernote devices Manta and Nomad have received the sticker feature. Not only can you use the built-in stickers in your notes, but you can also create your own sticker collections. I have also created a few collections to help me out.

### BPMN
I need Business Process Model and Notation ([BPMN](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/PDF)) from time to time for work, and sometimes I use it to describe the workflow of my "applications" that I have created with Obsidian (e.g. https://github.com/malleVF/Threat-Research-with-Obsidian-for-SOC-Analysts). My collection contains only a small selection that I use most often for my work.

### Dashboard Design
I have created 3 collections for sketching dashboards.
Tiles in various sizes based on the 5 mm grid template from Supernote for the layout design of a report:

- **Rep-Tile Landscape**

- **Rep-Tile Portrait**

The third collection contains the diagrams. Their size can be adjusted to fit the tiles:
- **Rep-Charts**

### STIX Icons (EclecticIQ)
STIX-Icons is a collection of clean icons for use in software, training and marketing material to visualize cyber threats according to the STIX language for intelligence exchange.

### Template Icons
**Template Icons** is the collection of icons I use in PowerPoint to create interactive PDF templates. It's basically a copy of my scribbled icons from Licude. The collection helps me get my ideas down on paper before I start designing on my PC. 
You can also use it to create the templates directly in Supernote and export them as PNG images to use as templates. The process of template development via PowerPoint is not necessarily required.

### Weather Icons
I came across a collection of weather symbols and thought it was a great idea to reduce the number of stickers by following the principle of a puzzle. This allows me to create different variations of cloud stickers, and so I only need a handful of icons to describe the weather.

### My Collection
Just for testing stuff.
